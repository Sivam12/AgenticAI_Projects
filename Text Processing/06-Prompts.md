| **3. Context + Task**            | *“Context: The document describes 10 Ancient Dynasties of India. Task: Write a summary in 5 bullet points for high schoolers.”* | Clear focus, avoids ambiguity               |
| **4. Example-based**             | *“Example: Gupta Empire → Golden Age of India, great progress in art and science. Now do the same for Mauryan Dynasty.”*        | Format control, predictable structure       |
| **5. Instruction + Constraints** | *“Summarize the dynasties: (a) Use bullet points, (b) Limit to 200 words, (c) Avoid repeating the phrase ‘ancient dynasties’.”* | Consistency, structured outputs             |
| **6. Step-by-Step (CoT - Chain of Thoughts)**        | *“List the dynasties first. Then describe one key contribution of each. Finally, give a conclusion sentence.”*                  | Reasoning, analysis, problem-solving        |
| **7. Multi-turn**                | *Q: What are the dynasties mentioned? → A: \[List] → Q: Summarize each in one sentence.*                                        | Interactive exploration, tutoring agents    |
| **8. Template-based**            | *“\[ROLE] Historian. \[TASK] Summarize. \[OUTPUT FORMAT] Dynasty (Time Period): Contribution.”*                                 | Standardization, automation-ready prompts   |
